  Rice decompression for FITS tiled image compression (ZCMPTYPE = 'RICE_1').

  This is a Pascal conversion of the decompression routines of ricecomp.c
  from NASA's CFITSIO library (https://github.com/HEASARC/cfitsio).
  It was created by Han Kleijn, www.hnsky.org for the ASTAP program


  Original copyright / attribution from ricecomp.c:

    The following code was written by Richard White at STScI and made
    available for use in CFITSIO in July 1999.  These routines were
    originally contained in 2 source files: rcomp.c and rdecomp.c,
    and the 'include' file now called ricecomp.h was originally called
    buffer.h.

    SOFTWARE OR SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER.

  Conversion notes (Pascal version):
  - Only the three decompression routines are converted here:
      fits_rdecomp        for BYTEPIX=4  (ZBITPIX  32, unsigned int  output)
      fits_rdecomp_short  for BYTEPIX=2  (ZBITPIX  16, unsigned short output)
      fits_rdecomp_byte   for BYTEPIX=1  (ZBITPIX   8, unsigned char output)
    The compression routines (rcomp.c part) can be added later.
  - The C code relies on unsigned 32-bit wraparound in "diff+lastpix" and on
    "~(diff>>1)". This unit therefore switches range and overflow checks off
    locally (directives $R- and $Q-); dword arithmetic then wraps modulo
    2^32 exactly like C unsigned int.
  - Note that beginning with CFITSIO v3.08, end-of-buffer (EOB) checking was
    removed from the C code to improve speed, keeping only one check per
    coding block. This conversion keeps the original per-block check, so as
    in C the input buffer should be allocated somewhat larger (rule of
    thumb: 1% larger than the uncompressed pixel array) to guarantee that a
    corrupt stream cannot read past the end before the block check triggers.
    When decompressing a FITS tile, simply pass the heap array with a few
    spare bytes after the tile, or copy the tile to a padded buffer.
  - ffpmsg() error reporting is replaced by an error string returned in the
    optional out parameter of the wrapper function rice_decode() and by the
    integer results (0 = success, 1 = failure) of the low-level routines,
    identical to the C convention.
==============================================================================}

{$mode objfpc}{$H+}
{ IMPORTANT: the two directives below are essential and must not be removed.

  The Rice algorithm (both the CFITSIO-ported decoders and the encoder)
  relies on unsigned arithmetic wrapping modulo 2^32, exactly like C
  "unsigned int": expressions such as  diff + lastpix,  not(diff shr 1)
  and the branchless (un)zigzag mapping intentionally overflow and are
  then truncated.  With range or overflow checking enabled these lines
  would raise run-time errors 201/215 instead of producing the correct
  wrapped values.

  Because $R- and $Q- are LOCAL source directives, they override any
  project, IDE or command-line settings (-Cr, -Co) for all code in this
  unit.  The correctness of this unit therefore does NOT depend on the
  build configuration.

  Consequence: code copied OUT of this unit into another unit compiled
  with $R+ or $Q+ may fail at run time even though it is correct here. }

  Rice COMPRESSION (encoder).

  Converted from the rcomp.c part of CFITSIO's ricecomp.c (same copyright /
  attribution as the decoder above).  Only the 16-bit routine is converted,
  because ASTAP compresses only 16-bit integer FITS images (BITPIX = 16),
  which is the only case Rice can compress losslessly and is the intended
  use (many short exposures stored as .fz).

  fits_rcomp_short mirrors fits_rdecomp_short exactly:
    fsbits = 4, fsmax = 14, bbits = 16, first pixel stored raw big-endian.

  The output is a self-contained compressed tile, byte-for-byte identical to
  what CFITSIO's fpack produces, so funpack / CFITSIO / astropy can read it and
  this unit's own fits_rdecomp_short round-trips it exactly.
